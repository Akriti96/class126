What is ngrok?
Your development machine may be connected to a secure network behind a firewall. To work around access restrictions, ngrok runs a small client process on your machine which creates a private connection tunnel to the cloud service. Your localhost development server is mapped to an ngrok.io sub-domain, which a remote user can then access. Thereâ€™s no need to expose ports, set up forwarding, or make other network changes.
